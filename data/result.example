Subject: Status Update on Project C-String-Lib

Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check in on the current status of our project C-String-Lib.
Specifically, I’m interested in how far you’ve progressed with implementing the planned functions of the string library and whether there are any challenges where I could offer support.

It would be great if you could provide a brief update so we can plan the next steps.

Thanks in advance!

Best regards,
Alice
